# LessonGen
Generate lessons for StenoMaster from Plover logs.

To use, first enable logs and `log translations` in Plover's configuration. Also make sure you're saving the log file to an appropriate location on your computer.

If you already had logs enabled, you might want to clear its contents so that you're not seeing old logs.

Once you've done that, Make sure Plover & your dictionaries are enabled and type out in steno the contents you want for the lesson. Feel free to use asterisk to undo strokes like normal.

Once you've finished stenoing the lesson, drag the log file into the webpage:
<https://efhiii.github.io/LessonGen>

You should see a preview of the interpreted logs and a download button to download the lesson file.
